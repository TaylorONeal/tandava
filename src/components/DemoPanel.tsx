/**
 * DEMO PANEL — For the live demo site only.
 *
 * This floating side panel lets visitors switch between roles and shows
 * contextual information about what they're seeing. It only renders when
 * VITE_DEMO_MODE=true.
 *
 * HOW TO REMOVE:
 * Delete this file and remove the <DemoPanel /> from App.tsx.
 * Or just set VITE_DEMO_MODE=false — the panel won't render.
