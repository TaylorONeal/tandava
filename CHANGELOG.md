# Changelog

All notable changes to Tandava are documented here. The format is loosely based
on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project follows
[SemVer](https://semver.org/) (pre-1.0, so minor versions may include breaking
schema changes).

## [Unreleased] — Deploy & transaction hardening

### Added
- **Web Component embed** (`public/widget.js`, `<tandava-schedule>`): a
  no-iframe alternative to the script/iframe widget for sites/CMS plans that
  strip iframes — renders the public schedule into shadow DOM via the
  `get_public_schedule` RPC. The `/manage/embed` generator gained this snippet
  (prefilled with the deployment's Supabase URL/publishable key) plus a **live
  preview** of the widget. Guide documents both options and why booking hands off
  to a new tab (browser storage partitioning).

### Fixed
- **Migration conflict that broke `supabase db push`.** Removed the legacy
  `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`, which defined an outdated
  `classes`/`messages` model and collided with the canonical `00001–00010`
  series (duplicate `CREATE TABLE`). `DEPLOYMENT.md` now references the correct
  migration series.
- **Events type/schema drift.** `StudioEvent`, `EventSession`,
  `EventPricingTier`, and `EventRegistration` in `src/types/database.ts` no
  longer declare columns that don't exist in the schema (e.g. `session_ids`,
  `series_id`); they now mirror the `events` tables exactly, and the
  `EventType`/`EventStatus`/`EventRegistrationStatus` enums match the DB enums.
- **`stripe-webhook` wrote non-existent columns** (legacy
  `memberships.plan_name`/`classes_remaining`/`user_id`). Handlers now insert
  into the canonical `transactions`, `bookings`, `memberships`, and
  `class_packs` tables and map Stripe statuses to the `membership_status` enum.

### Added
- **Embeddable booking widget.** A one-line `<script>` (`public/embed.js`) that
  studios paste on their own website (Squarespace / Wix / WordPress) to show their
  live schedule, a "Book Now" lightbox button, or a single event. It injects a
  sandboxed, auto-resizing (postMessage) iframe over chrome-less `/embed/*` routes
  that read public data via a narrow `get_public_schedule` `SECURITY DEFINER` RPC
  (`migration 00016`) — only safe columns of a discoverable studio's *upcoming*
  classes; the base table stays participants-only. No keys on the page;
  booking/checkout open top-level in a new tab. Times render in the studio's
  timezone, and live embeds show a real empty state (demo rows only in demo mode).
  `getPublicSchedule` + `usePublicSchedule`;
  an in-app snippet generator / how-it-works page at `/manage/embed`; and the
  `docs/guides/website-embed.md` guide. Surfaced in the demo feature grid + README.
- **Route-level RBAC.** `/manage`, `/teach`, `/staff`, and authenticated member
  routes are now wrapped in `ProtectedRoute` (previously only `/admin` was).
  Added a `studio.teach` permission for the instructor portal. Demo mode still
  bypasses all guards.
- **Payments backend.** New `stripe-checkout` (drop-in, membership subscription,
  class pack) and `stripe-portal` Edge Functions — the functions the frontend
  was already calling but that did not exist. Prices are read server-side;
  callers are identified by JWT. Supports single-studio (direct charge) and
  platform (Stripe Connect destination charge, optional `PLATFORM_FEE_BPS`).
- **Email backend.** `supabase/functions/email/index.ts` HTTP entry point with a
  template dispatcher over the existing provider abstraction (Resend / SendGrid /
  SMTP / console).
- **Onboarding provisioning.** The 11-step setup wizard (`/manage/onboarding`)
  now persists when a backend is configured: a new `onboarding` Edge Function
  creates the studio (+ links the caller as owner on the first step) and upserts
  location, branding, a starter offering, and starter pack/membership pricing.
  `handleSave` posts each step (with a saving state); demo stays toast-only.
- **SMS + web push notifications.** New `sms` Edge Function (Twilio / console
  providers + templates: class reminder, waitlist promoted, class cancelled,
  booking confirmation) and `push` Edge Function (Web Push/VAPID, delivers to a
  member's `push_subscriptions`, prunes stale ones). `migration 00015` adds the
  `push_subscriptions` table + RLS. Typed client dispatch helpers
  (`sendEmail`/`sendSms`/`sendPush` in `src/lib/notifications/dispatch.ts`).
- **CSV import persistence** (`supabase/functions/import-members`): a
  service-role Edge Function that turns the validated/deduped records into a real
  studio roster — creates an auth user per new member (profile via the existing
  trigger) or reuses an existing profile by email, fills in profile fields, links
  `studio_members` (deduped), and records an `import_jobs` row. Authorizes the
  caller as studio staff and derives the studio from their staff row. The import
  wizard calls it when a backend is configured (demo stays a local dry-run).
- **Real CSV import engine** (`src/lib/connectors/`): a dependency-free RFC 4180
  parser, value transforms (`to_date`, `to_cents`, `to_phone`, …), alias-aware
  column auto-matching, and required-field/email validation with dedupe — plus
  13 unit tests. The import wizard now parses the user's actual file and reports
  real counts, preview rows, and validation errors instead of mock data.
- **Event registration + deposits (go-live).** `migration 00014` adds
  `events.deposit_cents` / `allow_payment_plan` and `event_registrations`
  deposit/balance columns + atomic count-bump RPCs. The `stripe-checkout`
  function gained a `workshop` type (server-side price recompute — early-bird /
  member / tier — plus deposit vs full), and `stripe-webhook` creates the
  `event_registrations` row + `workshop` transaction and bumps registration
  counts. `checkoutEvent()` client helper + a `resolveDeposit()` pricing helper
  (tested). `EventRegistrationPanel` now shows a Pay-in-full / Pay-deposit choice
  with the balance-due-later note.
- **Workshop registration UX (Mindbody-style).** New event pricing core
  (`src/lib/events/pricing.ts`, 16 tests): resolves the applicable price
  (early-bird window vs member vs regular vs tier — lowest wins), computes
  registration state (status + open/close window + capacity → open / not-open /
  closed / sold-out / waitlist), and filters sessions per tier for partial-series
  registration. New reusable `EventRegistrationPanel` component (tier picker,
  member toggle, auto-resolved price with savings, multi-session schedule with
  per-tier coverage, capacity bar, state-aware CTA), wired into the event detail
  page with a demo partial-series ("Full Immersion" vs "Foundations Audit").
- **Booking entitlement engine** (`src/lib/booking/entitlements.ts`): pure,
  tested logic that resolves a member's memberships/class packs against a class
  (scope by offering + location, status, billing period, usage limits, expiry),
  recommends the best covering source, and determines late-cancel — 19 unit
  tests. `BookingModal` now derives its payment options from this engine
  (`paymentSources` prop) instead of hardcoded mock coverage.
- **Booking data-access layer.** Extended the typed `Database` with the tables
  the booking flow reads (`locations`, `offerings`, `class_occurrences`,
  `membership_types`, `class_packs`, `class_pack_types`); added backend methods
  `getUpcomingClasses()` and `getMemberEntitlements()`; added React Query hooks
  (`useUpcomingClasses`, `useMemberEntitlements`, `useBookingSources`,
  `useBookClass`) in `src/hooks/useBooking.ts`. `BookingModal` gained an optional
  `onConfirm` callback so a caller can perform the real booking (covered →
  `data.bookClass()`, drop-in → Stripe checkout); the demo simulation remains the
  fallback.
- **`cancel_booking()` RPC** (`migration 00013`): cancellation with late-cancel
  detection — on-time cancels refund the consumed membership/pack class; late
  cancels (inside `studios.default_cancellation_minutes`) forfeit it and record a
  `late_cancel_fee` transaction. Waitlist promotion is handled by the existing
  trigger. Exposed as `data.cancelBooking()` + the `useCancelBooking` hook.
- **`book_class()` RPC** (`migration 00012`): atomic, `SECURITY DEFINER`
  server-side booking against a membership or class pack — re-validates
  eligibility (mirroring the engine), books confirmed/waitlisted by capacity,
  and decrements the entitlement in one transaction. Exposed through the backend
  abstraction as `data.bookClass()` (typed `book_class` in the `Database`
  `Functions` map). Drop-in/paid bookings continue through Stripe Checkout.
- **Event registration window** (`migration 00011`):
  `events.registration_opens_at` / `registration_closes_at`.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` June 2026 review section, `CHANGELOG.md`, and updated
  `README.md` / `DEPLOYMENT.md` / `.env.example`.

### Changed
- `src/lib/stripe.ts` checkout helpers now pass canonical IDs
  (`occurrenceId`, `membershipTypeId`, `classPackTypeId`).
- `package.json` version aligned to the documented pre-1.0 line (`0.1.0`).
