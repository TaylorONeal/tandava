# PRD: Interactive Demo Experience

> **September 2026 proposal:** See the [demo and navigation review](../HOSTED_PRODUCT_REVIEW.md#3-demo-and-navigation-fixes). The follow-up implementation restores an optional tour from the demo bar, and the feature statuses below describe simulated UI, not production workflows. The proposed acquisition path supports both self-hosting and a future hosted service, using optional task-based guidance and explicit simulation labels.

**Last Updated:** February 2026
**Status:** Implemented

---

## Overview

The interactive demo is Tandava's primary acquisition tool. Studio owners, teachers, and prospective users land on the demo page, choose a role, and explore a fully functional UI with mock data. Every button must provide feedback, every flow must feel complete, and the experience must compel visitors to download and self-host Tandava for their studio.

## Demo Mode Architecture

### Context Chain
```
DemoProvider (tracks active role/persona)
  -> AuthProvider (reads persona, sets profile/permissions)
    -> Router (all routes accessible in demo mode)
      -> ProtectedRoute (bypassed: returns children directly)
```

### Data Strategy
- All data is mock/hardcoded in component files or `src/data/demo/`
- User actions (book, cancel, add class, check in) modify **local React state**
- Toast notifications confirm every action
- Nothing persists across page reload — by design

### Role Switching
- **DemoRoleBar** (prominent sticky top bar, z-index 110) shows current role and enables instant switching
- Shows current role with accent-colored badge (amber=Owner, blue=Instructor, violet=Front Desk, teal=Member)
- One-click role switching buttons always visible
- Green pulsing "DEMO" indicator + persona name
- Only renders when `DEMO_MODE_ENABLED` is true
- Switching calls `switchPersona(role)` in DemoContext + navigates to role destination
- AuthContext syncs profile + permissions via useEffect
- Back links removed from all layouts — roles are parallel perspectives, not hierarchical
- **DemoPanel** (floating side panel) still exists as secondary access

## Design Principles

1. **Every button does something** — Either performs a demo action with toast, or explains what the production feature would do
2. **No empty states** — All pages have mock data that looks realistic
3. **No console.logs** — All debug output replaced with toast notifications
4. **Current dates** — All mock dates reference 2025-2026, never 2023-2024
5. **Filters work** — Search, dropdowns, and filter controls actually filter content
6. **Role context is clear** — DemoPanel always shows current role and page context
7. **Navigation is complete** — Every sidebar link has a route and component

## Success Metrics

A successful demo experience means:
1. Visitor chooses a role and understands the platform within 60 seconds
2. Every click produces visible feedback (navigation, toast, state change)
3. Studio owner sees enough value to clone the repo
4. No broken links, empty states, or unresponsive buttons
5. Works fully without any backend — pure client-side demo
