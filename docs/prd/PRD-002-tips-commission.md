**I want to** see my tip balance and know when/how it will be paid out,
**So I can** trust the system and plan my finances accordingly.

**I want to** see real-time commission tracking across all transactions,
**So I can** monitor profitability and ensure accurate teacher payouts.

## Edge Cases

### EC-1: Student Tips After Cancellation
**Scenario:** Student tips instructor but later cancels/refunds their class booking.
**Handling:**
- Tip is non-refundable (clearly stated before tipping)
- Exception: Studio admin can manually refund tip with reason
- If tip was part of "round up," only round-up portion kept

### EC-2: Split Classes (Co-Teaching)
**Scenario:** Two instructors co-teach a workshop; student wants to tip.
**Handling:**
- Show both instructor names with individual tip options
- Or: single tip with split selection (50/50, custom %)
- Default: equal split, student can adjust
- Each instructor sees their portion

### EC-3: Sub Gets the Tip
**Scenario:** Student tips after class but a sub taught instead of scheduled teacher.
**Handling:**
- Tip goes to teacher who actually taught (the sub)
- Original teacher not shown in tip flow for that class
- Clear on confirmation: "Tip for [Sub Name] teaching [Class]"

### EC-4: Negative Net Class (Pay > Revenue)
**Scenario:** Low attendance means teacher pay exceeds class revenue.
**Handling:**
- Dashboard shows negative margin for that class
- Studio still pays teacher full amount (per agreement)
- Alert if pattern emerges (3+ consecutive negative classes)
- Suggest: minimum attendance policies, class cancellation thresholds

### EC-5: Payment Method Fails on Tip
**Scenario:** Saved card declines when student tries to tip.
**Handling:**
- Show friendly error with retry option
- Allow adding new payment method inline
- Don't persist failed tip attempt
- Allow later tipping from booking history

### EC-6: Retroactive Pay Rate Change
**Scenario:** Studio changes teacher's rate mid-pay-period.
**Handling:**
- New rate applies to future classes only
- Option to specify effective date
- Audit log shows rate change with timestamp
- Warning if backdating would affect processed payroll

### EC-7: Tax Considerations for Large Tips
**Scenario:** Instructor receives large tip ($100+).
**Handling:**
- System still processes normally
- Flagged in reporting (potential 1099 implications)
- Year-end summary shows total tips for tax filing
- Disclaimer: "Consult tax professional; tips are taxable income"

### EC-8: Tip to Inactive/Departed Instructor
**Scenario:** Student tries to tip instructor who has left the studio.
**Handling:**
- If within payout period, tip still goes to instructor's account
- If instructor deactivated, tip held in escrow
- Admin can release held tips or refund to student
- 90-day limit, then auto-refund

## Open Questions

1. **Tip processing fees:** Should the studio absorb Stripe's ~2.9% + $0.30 fee, or pass it to the tipper/instructor?

2. **Anonymous tipping:** Should students have the option to tip anonymously? What are the tax implications?

3. **Tip pooling legality:** In some jurisdictions, tip pooling has legal restrictions. Should we have location-based configuration?

4. **Instant payout limits:** What should the minimum/maximum for instant payouts be? Should there be daily/weekly limits?

5. **Commission model complexity:** Should we support more complex models (e.g., different rates for different class sizes, first X classes, etc.)?

6. **Multi-location teachers:** How should commissions work for teachers who work at multiple studio locations?

7. **Backdating commissions:** Should admin be able to backdate commission changes, and if so, how far back?

## Worker Classification

### Contractor vs. Employee

Most yoga studios classify teachers as **independent contractors (1099)**, not employees (W-2). This affects:

| Aspect | Contractor (1099) | Employee (W-2) |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Tax withholding | None - teacher handles | Studio withholds |
| Benefits | Not eligible | May be eligible |
| Overtime | Not applicable | Required >40hrs |
| 1099 reporting | Required if >$600/year | W-2 instead |
| Schedule control | Teacher has flexibility | Studio sets schedule |

### Database Support

```sql
ALTER TABLE studio_staff ADD COLUMN
  worker_classification TEXT DEFAULT 'contractor'
  CHECK (worker_classification IN ('employee', 'contractor'));

ALTER TABLE studio_staff ADD COLUMN
  tax_id_encrypted BYTEA,          -- SSN/EIN (encrypted)
  w9_received_at TIMESTAMPTZ;      -- W-9 on file date
```

### 1099 Year-End Export

Studios must provide 1099-NEC forms for contractors paid >$600:

```sql
-- Generate 1099 report
SELECT
  p.full_name,
  SUM(pe.calculated_amount_cents) / 100.0 as total_paid
FROM payroll_entries pe
JOIN studio_staff ss ON pe.teacher_id = ss.profile_id
JOIN profiles p ON ss.profile_id = p.id
WHERE ss.worker_classification = 'contractor'
  AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM pe.class_date) = 2025
  AND pe.is_paid = true
GROUP BY p.id
HAVING SUM(pe.calculated_amount_cents) >= 60000;  -- $600+
```

## Pay Model Selection Guide

### By Studio Type

| Studio Type | Recommended Models | Rationale |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Boutique (1 location, <10 teachers)** | `per_class` or `hybrid` | Simple, predictable costs |
| **Growing (2-3 locations)** | `hybrid` or `tiered` | Incentivize class growth |
| **Established (high attendance)** | `revenue_share` or `tiered` | Align teacher/studio interests |
| **Hot yoga / High volume** | `per_student` or `per_student_base` | Fair for varying class sizes |
| **Specialty (workshops, trainings)** | `revenue_share` + bonus | Reward expertise and marketing |

### By Teacher Experience

| Teacher Level | Recommended Approach |
|---------------|---------------------|
| **New teachers** | `per_class` with modest rate, increase after 6 months |
| **Experienced** | `hybrid` with base + small revenue share |
| **Star teachers** | `revenue_share` or `tiered` with attendance bonuses |
| **Guest/workshop** | `revenue_share` (40-60%) or flat workshop fee |

### By Growth Stage

| Stage | Model | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| **Startup (<1 year)** | `per_class` flat rate | Predictable costs while building |
| **Growing (1-3 years)** | `hybrid` | Balance cost control with incentives |
| **Established (3+ years)** | `tiered` or `per_student` | Optimize for class performance |
| **Multi-location** | Location-specific models | Different markets, different economics |
