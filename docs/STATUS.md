# Project Status

> **September 10, 2026 review:** The [product completeness and hosted launch review](HOSTED_PRODUCT_REVIEW.md) supersedes conflicting readiness claims in this February snapshot. Current code includes real auth adapters, lazy routes and registered staff routes, but core booking/import/onboarding remain simulated. Clean dependency installation failed, and two incompatible initial schema tracks require reconciliation. Hosted production readiness has not been established.

See [implementation follow-up](IMPLEMENTATION_HANDOFF.md) for repaired installation, tour/check-in bugs, dependency updates, and tested hosted-domain/readiness foundations.

Current state of Tandava for evaluators, contributors, and potential users.

**Last Updated:** February 2026

## Overview

Tandava is in **active development**. The interactive demo showcases UI and user workflows across all four roles (Student, Teacher, Studio Owner, Front Desk). All features use mock data with local React state — no backend required to explore.

Production deployment requires connecting the Supabase backend (schema and migrations exist but are not wired to the UI).

---

## What Works (Demo Mode)

These features are interactive in demo mode with mock data. Actions (booking, canceling, adding classes) update local state and show toast confirmations, but nothing persists across page reloads.

### Student Features

## What Does NOT Work Yet

### Not Connected to Backend
| Feature | UI Exists | Backend Status | Notes |
|---------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| **Authentication** | Complete | Mock only | Supabase Auth configured, using demo personas |
| **Data persistence** | Complete | Schema ready | 10 migration files (7,500+ lines SQL), not wired to UI |
| **Payment processing** | Partial | Not connected | Stripe Connect types exist, no live integration |
| **Email sending** | Partial | Provider abstraction exists | Resend/SendGrid/SMTP abstraction layer, no triggers |
| **Real-time updates** | None | Not implemented | No Supabase realtime subscriptions |

### Missing Features
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Front desk check-in page | Placeholder only | Component exists at `/staff/checkin` but route not registered in App.tsx; shows empty state |
| Calendar view | Not implemented | Schedule page has toggle button, shows "Coming soon" |
| Reviews/ratings submission | Placeholder | "Reviews coming soon" on instructor pages |
| iCal/calendar sync | Not implemented | No calendar export functionality |
| Waitlist auto-promotion | Types only | Notification types defined, no promotion logic |
| Recurring booking UI | Schema only | Database tables exist, no user-facing form |
| SMS sending | Not connected | Twilio settings UI exists, no actual integration |

## Technical Debt

### Performance
- [ ] No code splitting — all routes are statically imported in `App.tsx`
- [ ] No `React.lazy()` usage for `/manage/*`, `/teach/*`, `/admin/*` routes
- [ ] Images from Unsplash CDN (7+ files reference `images.unsplash.com`)

### Missing Assets
- [ ] `/public/og-image.png` — social share image (referenced in meta tags but missing)
- [ ] `/public/icons/` — PWA icon directory (missing)

### Code Quality
- [ ] `FeatureSettings.tsx:517` — `TODO: Save to API`
- [ ] `AuditLogs.tsx:726` — `TODO: Implement export`
- [ ] Hardcoded demo data throughout page components (should centralize in `src/data/demo/`)

---

## Database Schema

**Status:** Ready (not connected)

- 10 migration files in `/supabase/migrations/` totaling 7,500+ lines of SQL
- Covers: studios, locations, rooms, offerings, sessions, bookings, check-ins, memberships, transactions, teachers, staff, notifications, campaigns, audit logs, and more
- Row-Level Security (RLS) policies defined for multi-tenancy
- All tables isolated by `studio_id`

**To activate:**
1. Run `supabase start` (requires Docker)
2. Run `supabase db reset` to apply migrations
3. Update `.env.local` with Supabase credentials
4. Remove `VITE_DEMO_MODE=true`

---

## Backend Abstraction Layer

**Status:** Implemented

- `/src/lib/backend.ts` — provider-agnostic backend interface
- Abstracts auth, data queries, and storage operations
- Currently backed by mock/demo implementations
- Designed to swap in Supabase client without changing consumer code

---

## Deployment

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Vite build | Succeeds (clean) |
| TypeScript strict | No errors |
| ESLint | Configured (flat config, v9) |
| Environment handling | Proper `VITE_` prefix scoping |
| Service worker | Present (`/public/sw.js`) |
| License | AGPL-3.0 |
